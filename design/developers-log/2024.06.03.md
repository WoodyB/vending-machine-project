# Developer's Log, 2024.06.03

## Progress

* __Done:__ Reflect and write a retrospective.

See [Vending Machine Project Retrospective](https://woodyb.github.io/vending-machine-project/design/vending-machine-project-retrospective.pdf)

## What's Next ?

* I'm thinking about that now. I do want to start a new public project. I'm not sure what it will be just yet. Here's some goals I'm considering for the next project.
* Web application that deploys on AWS or Azure or maybe Vercel
* React front-end, maybe a NextJS app
* Maybe a REST API backend implemented as a NodeJS Express application
* Of course minium CD but this time CI not gated CI so no branches and no PRs
