# Developer's Log, 2024.05.06

## Progress

I was pulled away from this project but wanted to let you know I'm doing my best to get back to it this week. I didn't make any progress on the goals I set in the last log entry. However, I did manage to get a little bit of work done. I've updated the project so that these logs can be viewed in your browser more easily. In the main project Readme there's a link that uses githb.io (GitHub Pages) to display these logs in html. I've also added navigation at the bottom of each log entry to help readers navigate using a << Previous and Next >> link as well as a directory page for all log entries.

Seeing light at the end of the tunnel I realize the goals I set in the previous log entry were too ambitious so I'm going to reduce them.

## What I hope to have done by next log update

* Update document. The Vending Machine Diagram is behind the implementation now.
* Implement Sold Out user story
