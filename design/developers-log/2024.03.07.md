# Developer's Log, 2024.03.07

## Progress

* Fix for issue #411 Workflow [nodejs-ci.yml](https://github.com/WoodyB/vending-machine-project/blob/rc-454/.github/workflows/nodejs-ci.yml#L101) does not fail when PR is out of date with main trunk

I've been thinking a lot about what makes the most sense to work on next. Sketching and thinking on paper. I guess I'm just old school but I think better with pen and paper. I think I understand what has been tripping me up and I may have a reasonable way to fix it.

I've been struggling with how best to handle keyboard inputs and it struck me why. It's because I'm building a simulator. Of course real vending machines don't use keyboards. They may have keypads but that's different. What I've realized is I need to keep clear boundaries between the vending machine code and the simulator code. My thought is I may want to use the vending machine later to explore other areas and keeping it clean and modular will make it easier to do that. For example, I may want to put a React frontend on it. I may want to make it a web app running on AWS. Heck, I may even use it to play with Kubernetes someday. Keeping it clean now could allow me to get a great start later on a new learning adventure.

## What I hope to have done by next log update

* Add a design diagram document that explains how the simulator / vending machine interface
* Goal is to have a running state machine that can accept coins and display how much money has been inserted in the machine for the pending transaction.
* Implemented simulator / vending machine with clear boundaries.
