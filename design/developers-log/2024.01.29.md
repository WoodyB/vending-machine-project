## Progress

I'm glad to get back to this project. I did make some progress on the CI workflow. It has been a learning
journey to get the nodejs-ci.yml workflow to automatically merge the code changes when all the commit tests
pass. The way I finally got it to work was to add a call to a GitHub API endpoint. Maybe there was another way
but I just couldn't find it. Seemed like no matter what I did until I added the API call GitHub always required me to
click the merge button in the UI.

## What I hope to have done next iteration

* Create an immutable "binary" from the build and store it in an artifact repository
* Tag all source files that were used to create the "binary" artifact
