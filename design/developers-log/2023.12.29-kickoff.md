# Kickoff

## 2023-12-29

### Goals

1. Using TDD develop the project in TypeScript
2. Implement the project to run as a real-time system using the keyboard to simulate end users performing actions like inserting coins, selecting items to vend, pressing coin return to abort a transaction etc.
3. Implement Continuous Delivery for the project
4. Implement ATDD *acceptance test driven design*.
5. Implement the real-time system as a FSM *finite state machine*.

### Thoughts on where to begin

* Diagram a physical vending machine to help to us think through what are the parts of a vending machine
* Draw a FSM diagram to help us get our heads around how the machine works
* Write more stories to augment the stories already given in the description
* Pick one of the simplest things to implement from the stories and then write one test to get us going, following TDD rules.
