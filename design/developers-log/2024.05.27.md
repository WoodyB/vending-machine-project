# Developer's Log, 2024.05.22

## Progress

* __Done:__ Add acceptance tests for Exact Change Only
* __Done:__ Investigate DRYing up repeated code in VendingMachine idleAction() / exactChangeOnlyAction()
* __Done:__ Investigate adding coin inventory control to simulator
* __Done:__ Bonus: create a workflow that will keep the OAuth refresh token from expiring for Box.com

I did investigate adding coin inventory control to the simulator and decided not to at this time. I did change the default start money to only be 2 nickels. This makes it easy to put the machine into a Exact Change Only state. After start up if you insert 3 quarters then select candy to buy you will enter Exact Change Only state. Also, you can play with different amounts of start money without recompiling the code. Just modify the app-data.js file in the bin directory of where you built the project or installed the app.
 
## What I hope to have done by next log update

* Investigate / experiment with version 2.0 that replaces my poor man's finite state machine with a OOP state pattern.
