# Developer's Log, 2024.05.10

## Progress

* __Done:__ Update document. The Vending Machine Diagram is behind the implementation now.
* __Done:__ Implement Sold Out user story

I decided to not track inventory of products at this time. Cheaper vending machines just use a sensor to detect when a product type is empty. Instead I added methods to
simulate sensor detected product out for each product.

## What I hope to have done by next log update

* Eliminate VendingHandler.spec but preserve tests that should be kept by moving them into VendingMachine.spec at a higher level of abstraction
* Implement Exact Change Only user story
