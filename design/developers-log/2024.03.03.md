## Progress

* Finished Diagram of a physical vending machine see [vending-machine-diagram](https://woodyb.github.io/vending-machine-project/design/vending-machine-diagram.pdf) document.

* Finished FSM diagram to help us get our heads around how the machine works. This is also in the [vending-machine-diagram](https://woodyb.github.io/vending-machine-project/design/vending-machine-diagram.pdf) document.

I'm going to assume most of what is in this design is incorrect but I still think it was a worthwhile exercise. I'm going to trust TDD to help us find where it is wrong as we develop. We will update it as necessary as we learn.

## What I hope to have done next iteration

In my old ways of doing things I would trust the design work we've done a lot more then start developing the different parts of the system. Eventually I would have enough of it working to begin writing tests. But in this project I'm resisting this approach and will attempt to apply principles I've learned from TDD. I will likely fail but that's how we learn!  

* Pick one of the simplest things to implement from the stories and then write one test to get us going, following TDD rules.
* Repeat
* Completed by next iteration, ability to detect a valid coin has been inserted, the amount of the coin will be added to the current amount and the display will be updated.
